			<h2>About Nour</h2>
			<p>I'm Nour al-Zaghloul (thus the webpage). I am a Palestinian lesbian (and other queer) transfemme researcher. I obtained a Bachelor’s in Psychology (specializing in development) with a minor in education from the University of California, Davis. I have worked in a professional capacity in formal learning environments, academia, and informal learning environments.</p>
			
			<p>I started out working in various positions (both volunteered and paid) in school districts across Northern California where I really honed my ability to work with children of all ages and demographics.</p>
			
			<p>Then after getting a taste of research, I worked as a research assistant and later a lab manager for various labs at the University of California, Davis. Here was my formal introduction into academia and research in general. I developed skills in research design, statistical analysis, and the dissemination of findings.</p>
			
			<p>Afterwards, I moved to be the lab manager for a new research lab at Carnegie Mellon University. This gained me my specialization in creating and managing large scale projects as I had to build the lab from scratch. Everything put into production was personally developed and hand-coded.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, I moved into the informal learning world working as a researcher for the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh. At the museum I gained experience on both the more qualitative side of things as well as research application rather than theory.</p>
			
			<p>I currently reside in Pittsburgh, PA with my wonderful wife and two lovely cats.</p>

			<h2>CV & Resume</h2>
			<p>I am a research and data specialist who has over 12 years working with children, 8 years of programming professional solutions in many languages, and 7 years managing large scale projects in a myriad of contexts.</p>
			<p>I specialize in studying how systems interact to create changes over time. Originally, I was educated in developmental psychology focusing on emerging cognitive systems, but over time I have expanded onto the study of dynamic systems no matter their context. Currently I mainly do research focused around Diversity, Equity, Inclusivity, and Accessibility in informal learning spaces.</p>
			<p>Below is a recent resume showcasing my expertise with research and working with children.</p>

		<div class="page" id="ContactMe">
			<h2>Contact Me</h2>
			<p>I'm going to be blunt, if you want to contact me professionally please only do so through my email: <a href="mailto:nouralzaghloul@gmail.com">nouralzaghloul@gmail.com</a></p>
			<p>This is my professional website which will hold my updated resumes and any polished projects I can show off. For personal work you can look at my personal website <a href="www.nourthepigeon.com">nourthepigeon.com</a> which is mainly a commonplace book of various research I stumble into and the development of small projects. And then there is my very unprofessional website <a href="www.pigeonworkshop.com">pigeonworkshop.com</a> where I host experimental and work in progress projects with no real rhyme, reason, or signposting. </p>
			<p>Thank you for your interest though! Very flattered.</p>
